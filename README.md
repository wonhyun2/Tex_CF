# SFINCS Model Repository for Compound Flooding from Hurricanes Harvey and Beryl

This repository contains the input files, domain configurations, and model results for six hydrologically distinct coastal zones along the Texas Gulf Coast. The simulations were performed using the Super-Fast INundation of CoastS (SFINCS) model to assess the role of rapid intensification (RI) and relative sea-level rise (RSLR) on compound flooding, as presented in:

## üîç Overview

This study investigates compound flooding mechanisms by comparing two hurricane events:

- **Hurricane Harvey (2017)**: Slow-moving storm, extreme rainfall and river discharge.
- **Hurricane Beryl (2024)**: Rapidly intensifying storm, surge-dominated flooding.

We use SFINCS to simulate fluvial, pluvial, and surge-driven inundation for:
- All individual flood drivers
  a) tide-only
  b) tide+wind (Surge only)
  c) tide+wind+river
  d) tide+wind+rain  
- Compound scenarios (all-driver)
- Climate-adjusted RSLR scenario for Harvey
